# SYSCPPCP #
## Simple Yet Sophisticated C++ Class Persistence or SYSCPPCP ##  
Store C++ class data in a file and manipulate it programmatically or using SmallSQL(included)  
## Requirements:
Windows 10, 11 and Visual Studio Community 2022 (64-bit) - Current Version 17.11.5  (VS Code is not supported), Linux version coming soon 
## Installing  
To install and build the framework and SmallSQL application download the project as a zip file.  After you unzip the file go to SYSCPPCP directory in the Command Prompt or Power Shell window and execute the build.bat batch file. (./build for PS). The build will take about five minutes
This process will build a framework based on the sample templates from _\SYSCPPCP\SYSCPPCPcodeGenrtators\templates_ .
When you develop your application you will create a set of templates defining the classes in your application, build the framework and add code specific to your application.  More on this later.
  
## Getting familiar with the framework ##  
The best way to familiarize yourself with the framework is to execute the sample applications.
In Windows Explorer go to _\SYSCPPCP\SYSCPPCPtest\QuickStart_ and start _QuickStart.vcxproj_
Step through the code in debug mode.  You should be able to get an understanding of what actions you can perform.

Next, open a command prompt or power shell window and go to _SYSCPPCP\SmallSQL\releae and type_  __smallsql ../../syscppcp.dat__ (__./smallsql ../../syscppcp.dat__ for PS)  
You should get a SmallSQL prompt  
Type __cls__ to clean the screen  
Type SmallSQL> __select classes from dual__
```
    Classes(Tables)
    ===============
    Cat
    Child
    Customer
    Dog
    Family
    Invoice
    Item
    Person
```
This is a list the classes created during build based on the sample templates.  For each class a header _\SYSCPPCP\SYSCPPCPheaders_, a source file in _\SYSCPPCP\SYSCPPCPSource_, a project file in _\SYSCPPCP\SYSCPPCPvcxproj_ and a static library in _\SYSCPPCP\SYSCPPCPlibs_.  You will need them to build your application.
Type SmallSQL> __desc Customer__  
```
Enumerations
===========
  enum Type
   {
    Retail,
    WholeSale,
    OneTime
   };

Structures
========
struct Name
{
    char First[20];
    char Last [20];
};
Variables(columns)
==================
   int ID;
   Name name;
   char Address1 [41];
   char Address2 [21];
   char City  [21];
   char State  [3];
   char Zip [6];
   Type type ;
```
You will get the data members of the class - Variables(columns) -  an enumeration and structure declarations used to declare the variables 'type' and 'name'.
Try SmallSQL> __select * from Cat__
You will get a listing of all records of type Cat stored (serialized) to the database. The database file is _\SYSCPPCP\syscppcp.dat_.
Try
SmallSQL> __select name.First, name.Last from customer__  
Syntax Error: Table 'customer' does not exist.  
You get an error because class (table) names and variable(columns) names are case sensitive.  
The correct statement is   
__select name.First, name.Last from Customer__  
Notice that the column names are variable names as you would use them in a program.  
name is declared as a structure  
```
Name {
      char  First[20; 
      char Last [20];
    };
```
You can also try  
__select name.First, name.Last from Customer where State = NY and City = "New York"__  
Notice that only strings containing spaces need to be enclosed in quotes.  For  numbers and enumerations, no quotes or transformations are needed.
A few more rules,  
* Only one class(table) can be used in a query
* Maximum of five where clauses.
* Except for arrays of char, no arrays can be used in a query
* For enumerations you have to use the item name not the associated integer value
* You are not allowed to change the class variables declarations  

More examples  
SmallSQL> __update Customer set name.First = "Milton",  name.Last = "Gimbles" where ID = 4597__  
SmallSQL> __delete from Customer where type = OneTime__  
To exit type __bye__ or __exit__
__Note__: In your applications, as long as you don't change the generated code, you can declare other variables and functions.  The newly declared variables will not be stored in the database.
