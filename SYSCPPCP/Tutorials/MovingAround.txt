Moving around the directory structure
Here are the subdirectories in the SYSCPPCP :
SYSCPPCPcodeGenrtators - contains subdirectories for the code and executables for the code generations
 There are two code generators SmallSQLgenerator - generates codes and compiles the SmallSQL executable (stored in (SYSCPPCP/SmallSQL subrirectory)
                                                            SYSCPPCPgenerator -  - generates codes and compiles a library for the classes defined in the templates in the templates subdirectory
             templates subdirectory - contains templates defined by the user .  After install the directory contains the sample templates.  They have to be removed when starting development
            TemplatesSmallSQL - is used by SmallSQLgenerator
            debug and release contain the generator executables 
  SmallSQL - contains the debug and release versions of SmallSQL.exe
SmallSQLHeaders and SmallSQLsource  Headers and source code  for  SmallSQL  generated by SmallSQLgenerator
SYSCPPCPheaders and SYSCPPCPsource headers and source code for the classes defined in the tem[plates, generated by SYSCPPCPgenerator
SYSCPPCPlibs - for each class defined in the templates SYSCPPCPgenerator generates codes and then compiles a static library for each class stored here
SYSCPPCPvcxproj - for each class defined in the templates SYSCPPCPgenerator generates a VS project file used to compile the static libraries
SYSCPPCPtest - sample applications including a test data generator
Tutorials - documentation
In the SYSCPPCP directory thre is a batch file to build the system, build.bat, one to clean all the code generated, libs and executables, clean.bat and syscppcp.dat the sample database
After defining the templates and building the system you are interested only in SmallSQL.exe from the SmsllSQL directory, the static libraries from syscppcp.dat and the header files from SYSCPPCPheaders and the source code from SYSCPPCPsource for debuging. You can use the source code from SYSCPPCPsource to build your application or, recommended, derive classes and code your application there.
If you develop a console application you can use the SYSCPPCP directory structure and the project files of the sample applications.  Of course if you want to develop you own directory structure for your project you have to start from scratch.
