Getting started
Requirements:
Windows 10, 11 and Visual Studio Community 2022 (64-bit) - Current Version 17.11.5

Here is a check list on how to get started:
•	Expand syscppcp.zip
•	Open a command prompt or power shell window
•	Change the directory to SYSCPPCP 
•	Execute build.bat (./build in Power Shell)
•	The build will take about five minutes
This process will build a framework based on the sample templates.
When you develop your application you will create a set of templates defining the classes in your application, build the framework and add code specific to your application.  More on this later.

The best way to familiarize with the framework is to execute the sample applications.
In Windows Explorer go to SYSCPPCP\SYSCPPCPtest\QuickStart and start QuickStart.vcxproj
Step through the code in debug mode.  You should be able to get an understanding of what actions you can perform

Next,
Open a command prompt or power shell window and go to SmallSQL\release and type  smallsql ../../syscppcp.dat (./smallsql ../../syscppcp.dat for PS)
You should get a SmallSQL prompt
Type cls to clean the screen
Type SmallSQL> select classes from dual
    Classes(Tables)
    ===============
    Cat
    Child
    Customer
    Dog
    Family
    Invoice
    Item
    Person
This will list the classes created during build based on the sample templates.  For each class a header, source and project file is created and a static library is build
Type SmallSQL> desc Customer
Enumerations
===========
  enum Type
   {
    Retail,
    WholeSale,
    OneTime
   };

Structures
========
struct Name
{
    char First[20];
    char Last [20];
};
Variables(columns)
==================
   int ID;
   Name name;
   char Address1 [41];
   char Address2 [21];
   char City  [21];
   char State  [3];
   char Zip [6];
   Type type ;
You will get the data members of the class - Variables(columns) - and an enumeration and structure declarations used to declare the variables type and name.
Try
SmallSQL> select * from Cat
You will get a listing of all records of type Cat stored (serialized) to the database.
Try
SmallSQL> select name.First, name.Last from customer
Syntax Error: Table 'customer' does not exist.
You get an error because class (table) names and variable(columns) names are case sensitive.
The correct statement is  
select name.First, name.Last from Customer
Notice that the column names are variables as you would use them in a program.  
name is declared as a structure Name {
                                      char  First[20; 
                                     char Last [20];
                                    };
You can also try 
select name.First, name.Last from Customer where State = NY and City = "New York"
Notice that only strings containing spaces need to be enclosed in quotes.  For  numbers and enumerations no quotes ar transformations are needed
A few more rules, 
•	Only one class(table) can be used in a query
•	Maximum of five where clauses.
•	Except of arrays of char, no arrays can be used in a query
•	For enumerations you have to use the item name not the associated integer value
•	You are not alowed to change the classes variables declarations
Note: In your applications, as long as you don't change the generated code, you can declare other variables and functions.  The newly declared variables will not be stored in the database.
More examples
SmallSQL> update Customer set name.First = "Milton",  name.Last = "Gimbles" where ID = 4597
SmallSQL> delete from Customer where type = OneTime
To exit type bye or exit
